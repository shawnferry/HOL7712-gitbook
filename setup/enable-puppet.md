# Enabling Puppet on Solaris

So far, we have only executed puppet against a local manifest to bootstrap the lab environment. Given that the title of the lab '_Oracle Solaris Administration with Puppet'_ when can we get to some actual administration?

We are almost there but first we need to do a few more configuration steps. It is possible to do all the remaining configuration via puppet manifests but we use Solaris commands for some of the steps instead.

## Wait, What's SMF and Why Can't I Edit This File?

The Solaris Service Management Facility replaces traditional init scripts. Solaris has added stencils to convert repository data into traditional configuration files, puppet.conf is one of the files managed via stencils.
See [Introducing SMF Stencils](https://blogs.oracle.com/SolarisSMF/entry/introducing_smf_stencils) for much more information on the topic.

## puppet.conf Before Configuration


$$
PUP-SETUP-8
$$


![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-008.0.png)

1. Confirm that no configuration data present.
  `cat /etc/puppet/puppet.conf`

## Configure Puppet Master Server


$$
PUP-SETUP-9
$$


1. Change the config\/server property on puppet:master to set the name of the Puppet server. In this lab, everyone should be able to use the server called 'puppet'. In your environment, you would want to use the FQDN of your Puppet master.

  `svccfg -s puppet:master setprop config/server=puppet`

## Configure Puppet Agent Server


$$
PUP-SETUP-10
$$


1. Change the config\/server property on puppet:agent to set the name of the Puppet server. In this lab, everyone should be able to use the server called 'puppet'. In your environment, you would want to use the FQDN of your Puppet master.

  `svccfg -s puppet:agent setprop config/server=puppet`

## Refresh Puppet Master and Agent Configuration


$$
PUP-SETUP-11
$$


1. Refresh the Puppet services to reload the configuration.

  `svcadm refresh puppet:master puppet:agent`


![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-011.0.png)

## Enable Puppet Master and Agent Services


$$
PUP-SETUP-12
$$


1. Enable both the master and agent services, which also writes the puppet.conf file with the configuration data stored in SMF.

  `svcadm enable puppet:master puppet:agent`
  ![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-012.0.png)


## puppet.conf After SMF Configuration


$$
PUP-SETUP-13
$$


1. Review the`/etc/puppet/puppet.conf` file. As stated at the top   of the file; this file is generated by SMF. Do not make manual changes to this file.

## Place Puppet Agent Service in Maintenance State


$$
PUP-SETUP-14
$$


1. Place the puppet:agent in maintenance state, which stops the Puppet agent daemon from running and prevents later errors about Puppet already running while we manually run the agent. Disabling `puppet:agent` or `puppet:master` will result in the `[agent]`or`[master]`stanzas being removed.

  `svcadm mark maintenance puppet:agent`
  ![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-014.0.png)


## Check the State of the Puppet Agent and Master Services


$$
PUP-SETUP-15
$$


1. View the state of the Puppet services.
  `svcs puppet:master puppet:agent`
  ![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-015.0.png)

## Run the Puppet Agent


$$
PUP-SETUP-16
$$


1. We haven't written any manifests at this time. Without a manifest defined we are simply testing the connection to the master.

  `puppet agent -t`
  ![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-016.0.png)

  ### Wait, Aren't We the Master? How Do We Not Know Who We Are?

  Yes, the server called puppet is the master in the configuration. However, by default Puppet uses a FQDN or a couple of well known aliases for the Puppet server certificate. At this point in the configuration, the Puppet master cannot verify the identity of the agent and the agent is unable to verify the identity of the server.


## Finding the Problem \/ Fixing the Problem


$$
PUP-SETUP-17
$$


1. Optionally run `puppet resource host`Wait, what just happened? Almost all puppet providers know how to gather the state of an existing resource. Some will show you all the resources of that type, some will only show you the resource you pass on the command line. **Hint:** You can use this to output a valid puppet resource.

2. Use `puppet resource <resource> -e` to make a quick and dirty change to a resource
  `puppet resource -e host puppet-lab.oracle.lab`
  

3. Add the `host_aliases => ['puppet'],` parameter and value. There is no automatic syntax highlighting or validation.

## View the Host Resources Again


$$
PUP-SETUP-18
$$


1. Note the entry in host\_aliases for Puppet that was just added.

  `puppet resource host puppet-lab`
  ![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-018.0.png)


## Test the agent connection again


$$
PUP-SETUP-19
$$


1. `puppet agent -t`

  ![](/assets/SETUP-PUP-019.0.png)

2. We still see warnings because we have not written any manifests for the nodes but the connection is successful.

3. Why are there all these changes if there are no manifests to drive changes?

  The puppet agent automatically downloads all of the plugins on the master at the start of each run. Generally that means you will only see this the first time and agent talks to the server and after any plugin is updated on the server.

This completes the basic configuration of the puppet server in this lab.
